# Overview

The data set that is in this program contains synthetic weather data generated for ten different locations, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, and San Jose. It initially includes information of temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed. A link to this data set is below in the website labled 'Kaggle'.

I wrote this software to test out the library of Pandas in the Python Language. It is looking over this data and displaying it in a way that is able to be easily read by the user. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

* What was the average weather for these cities over the past year. 
The weather varied by area but I was able to find the average for each one.
* Am I able to convert the Temperature read to Farenheit instead of just reading it in Celsius.
Yes there is an option in the program to add Farenheit to the displayed data. 

# Development Environment

I built this within VSCode

I used Python and the library Pandas
